# Dave's useful reference materials

A collection of scripts, codeblocks, tricks and techniques I've picked up while doing stuff in the DS space.

## R Codeblocks

General codeblocks from Go Card project - [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/Data%20Science%20-%20R%20codeblocks%20that%20are%20super%20useful%20-%20Dave%20Ainscough.ipynb) and [HTML](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/Data%20Science%20-%20R%20codeblocks%20that%20are%20super%20useful%20-%20Dave%20Ainscough.html)

## Python Codeblocks

Some introduction to Python Notes from Automate the Boring Stuff - [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/Dave%20-%20Automate%20the%20Boring%20Stuff.ipynb) and [HTML](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/Dave%20-%20Automate%20the%20Boring%20Stuff.html)

DataCamp "Intro and Intermediate Data Science in Python" course notes - [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/DataCamp%20-%20Intro%2BIntermediate%20Python%20for%20Data%20Science.ipynb) and [HTML](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/DataCamp%20-%20Intro%2BIntermediate%20Python%20for%20Data%20Science.html)

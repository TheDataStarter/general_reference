# Dave's useful reference materials

A collection of scripts, codeblocks, tricks and techniques I've picked up while doing stuff in the DS space.

## R Codeblocks

General codeblocks from Go Card project - [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/Data%20Science%20-%20R%20codeblocks%20that%20are%20super%20useful%20-%20Dave%20Ainscough.ipynb) and [HTML](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/general_reference/blob/master/Data%20Science%20-%20R%20codeblocks%20that%20are%20super%20useful%20-%20Dave%20Ainscough.html)
